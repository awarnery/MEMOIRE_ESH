This paper argues that this transformation of the discipline involves more than just a rise of empirical work: it involves a new understanding of the relationship between theoretical and applied work, which raised the prestige of the latter. The meaning of economic theory and applied work and the boundaries between them changed as theory and empirical work alike became more applied in the sense that they were brought to bear on specific social issues, often with a policy orientation. Drawing on an analysis of John Bates Clark medal winners and on papers published in a special volume of History of Political Economy, to which this is an introduction, we then discuss reasons for this transformation. It resulted from new modeling strategies, data sets, and technologies as well as the changing influence of public and private patrons.},

While progress has been made, women in 2018 were only 32 percent of economics undergraduate students and 26 percent of academic economists. Our data also suggest several areas of stagnation and retreat. First, the percentage of female UK nationals studying economics is low and falling over time. Second, female economists are substantially more likely to be employed at lower academic ranks and in fixed-term—and generally lower status—teaching- and research-only positions. Third, the representation of women is especially low among ethnic minorities studying for an economics PhD. And finally, the percentage of economics professors with Asian ethnicity who are women has been falling over time, and at no point between 2012-2018 was a Black female professor of economics employed anywhere in the UK.},

Though many research economists instinctively know how to do so, most have spent too little time thinking about how one writes good research papers, and even the most successful economists often have a hard time articulating a clear answer to that question. This is due to both (i) what economists read and (ii) how they read it. The goal of this paper is to teach readers how to write applied economics papers that will eventually be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The various components of an applied economics paper are discussed in as much detail as possible, roughly in the order in which they are tackled in the context of the typical research project.},

Data from 1319 American first-year college students (872 female and 447 male) indicate that gender differences in computer self-efficacy, stereotypes, interests, values, interpersonal orientation, and personality exist. If students had had a positive experience in their first CS course, they had a stronger intention to take another CS course. A subset of 128 students (68 females and 60 males) took a CS course up to one year later. Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses. Furthermore, individuals who were highly conscientious and low in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades. Efforts to improve women’s representation in CS should bear these results in mind.},

As such, the histories written by econometricians reflect the scientific image of their discipline in a given period. Each image of a period is drawn by denominating forerunners and founding fathers and uses the language of the dominant philosophy of science of that day.             At the end of the nineteenth century, a scientific theory had to be mathematical; in the interbellum the image of science was that of logical positivism. In the 1970s and 1980s the dominant views were those of Karl Popper, Imre Lakatos, and Thomas Kuhn. Currently the scientific image in econometrics is the one of the Stanford school (Nancy Cartwright, Ian Hacking, and Patrick Suppes).},

  abstract = {In this paper, I suggest that the history of the classification system used by the American Economic Association (AEA) to list economic literature and scholars is a relevant proxy to understand the transformation of economics science throughout the twentieth century. Successive classifications were fashioned through heated discussions on the status of theoretical and empirical work, data and measurement, and proper objects of analysis. They also reflected the contradictory demands of users, including economists but also civil servants, journalists, publishers, librarians, and the military, and reflected rapidly changing institutional and technological constraints. Until the late 1940s, disagreements on the general structure of the classification dominated AEA discussions. As the subject matters, methods, and definition of economics rapidly evolved after the war, methodological debates raged on the status of theoretical and empirical work and the degree of unification of the discipline. It was therefore the ordering and content of major categories that was closely discussed during the 1956 revision. The 1966 revision, in contrast, was fueled by institutional and technical transformations rather than intellectual ones. Classifiers essentially reacted to changes in the way economists' work was evaluated, the nature and size of the literature they produced, the publishing industry, and the use of computer facilities. The final 1988–90 revision was an attempt by the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) editors to translate the mature core fields structure of their science into a set of codes and accommodate the new types of applied work economists identified themselves with. The 1990 classification system was only incrementally transformed in the next twenty years, but that the AEA is currently considering a new revision may signal more profound changes in the structure of economics.

The case of Dynare highlights how the dissemination across the profession of theoretical principles and modelling practices cannot be considered independently from (at least) two general issues that involve designing computer tools for macroeconomics: tractability (i.e. the existence of a computer algorithm that can solve a mathematical problem using “reasonable” resources) and portability (i.e. the material ability of circulating and transferring a computer algorithm across models, people, and institutions). In this article, we document how the origins and the development of Dynare over three decades were guided by these two issues.},

  abstract = {Apparue dans l’immédiat après-guerre, voire dans les années~1930, la pratique des expériences en économie a connu un essor important depuis les années~1970, une consécration dans les années~2000~à travers l’attribution de prix Nobel en économie expérimentale, et tout récemment la reconnaissance similaire des travaux pionniers d’Esther Duflo sur les Expériences Aléatoires Contrôlées (EAC) en économie du développement. Dans cet article nous nous intéressons aux deux méthodologies les plus couramment utilisées~: les EAC et celles qui entrent dans la catégorie de l’économie expérimentale. Partageant le même principe de base qui est de provoquer une observation dans le but d’étudier certains phénomènes, elles n’en diffèrent pas moins par leur origine et leur statut épistémologique. D’une part l’économie expérimentale, tournée vers la théorie, trouve ses origines dans une tentative réfutationniste dans les années~1970. D’autre part les EAC, tournées vers l’évaluation des politiques publiques, viennent d’une recherche de confirmation. Nous montrons par contre que l’influence conjointe des deux méthodologies a ensuite ébranlé une conception de l’économie décrite par Hausman [1992] comme science inexacte et séparée. Économie expérimentale et EAC ont œuvré pour que l’économie devienne une discipline moins généraliste et plus contextualisée. Elles ont aussi obligé les chercheurs, expérimentalistes, randomistes et théoriciens à repenser la définition du domaine de l’économie. Quand certains s’efforcent de le préciser, d’autres tentent de l’élargir, selon différentes conceptions de l’interdisciplinarité. Par contre, il semble que les différentes méthodologies expérimentales ne remettent que peu en question la théorie de la rationalité comme référence normative.},

Mais les . outils de modélisation économique utilisés ont été fort différents, au moins jusqu'aux années 1970. En France, les débats se déroulaient' dans les «commissions du Plan», et étaient menés dans le langage des ingénieurs et des statisticiens, qui avaient, de fait, tendance à envisager l'économie «comme une seule grande entreprise» et non comme le lieu de la compétition marchande. Les planificateurs néerlandais, en revanche, étaient souvent des universitaires, plus extérieurs à l'État. Ils travaillaient aussi sur une économie tournée vers le commerce mondial depuis des siècles et s'appuyaient sur l'enchaînement dynamique des fluctuations d'une économie marchande autonome, comme on tente de monter un cheval au galop. Les Français avaient - une vision plus technique et quantitative d'une économie dont la dynamique des prix était restée longtemps mystérieuse. - Le cours de cette économie était réduit à son année horizon. En revanche, la procédure sociale de discussion détaillée de cet horizon était privilégiée, à travers un circuit compliqué d'experts, de comptables nationaux, de commissions et de groupes de travail. .},

  abstract = {New knowledge in science and engineering relies increasingly on results produced by scientific software. Therefore, knowing how scientists develop and use software in their research is critical to assessing the necessity for improving current development practices and to making decisions about the future allocation of resources. To that end, this paper presents the results of a survey conducted online in October-December 2008 which received almost 2000 responses. Our main conclusions are that (1) the knowledge required to develop and use scientific software is primarily acquired from peers and through self-study, rather than from formal education and training; (2) the number of scientists using supercomputers is small compared to the number using desktop or intermediate computers; (3) most scientists rely primarily on software with a large user base; (4) while many scientists believe that software testing is important, a smaller number believe they have sufficient understanding about testing concepts; and (5) that there is a tendency for scientists to rank standard software engineering concepts higher if they work in large software development projects and teams, but that there is no uniform trend of association between rank of importance of software engineering concepts and project/team size.},

  abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive overview of the structure, strategy and methods of assessment of orthodox theoretical economics. In Part I Professor Hausman explains how economists theorise, emphasising the essential underlying commitment of economists to a vision of economics as a separate science. In Part II he defends the view that the basic axioms of economics are 'inexact' since they deal only with the 'major' causes; unlike most writers on economic methodology, the author argues that it is the rules that economists espouse rather than their practice that is at fault. Part III links the conception of economics as a separate science to the fact that economic theories offer reasons and justifications for human actions, not just their causes. With its lengthy appendix introducing relevant issues in philosophy of science, this book is a major addition to philosophy of economics and of social science.},

A prior theoretical formulation can be retained unaltered while searching over more variables than the available sample size from non-stationary data to select congruent, encompassing relations with invariant parameters on valid conditioning variables.},

Unlike other technologies supporting science, software can be copied and distributed at essentially no cost, potentially opening the door to unprecedented levels of sharing and collaborative innovation. Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

  abstract = {Research software is a driving force in today's academic ecosystem, with most researchers relying on it to do their work, and many writing some of their own code. Despite its importance, research software is typically not included in tenure, promotion, and recognition policies and processes. In this article, we invite discussions on how to value research software, integrate it into academic evaluations, and ensure its sustainability. We build on discussions hosted by the US Research Software Sustainability Institute and by the international Research Software Engineering community to outline a set of possible activities aimed at elevating the role of research software in academic career paths, recognition, and beyond. One is a study to investigate the role of software contributions in academic promotions. Another is to document and share successful academic recognition practices for research software. A third is to create guidance documents for faculty hiring and tenure evaluations. Each of these proposed activities is a building block of a larger effort to create a more equitable, transparent, and dynamic academic ecosystem. We've assembled 44 such ideas as a starting point and posted them as issues in GitHub {$<$}https://github.com/si2-urssi/policy/issues?q=is\%3Aissue+is\%3Aopen+label\%3AActivity{$>$} . Our aim is to encourage engagement with this effort. Readers are invited to do this by adding potential activities or commenting on existing ideas to improve them. The issues page can also serve to inform the community of ongoing activities so that efforts aren't duplicated. Similarly, if someone else has already made strides in a particular area, point out their work to build collective knowledge. Finally, the issues page is also intended to allow anyone interested in collaborating on a specific activity to indicate their willingness to do so. This living list serves as a hub for collective action and thought, with the overall aim of recognizing the value of creating and contributing research software.},

We then explore these questions in the context of the Monte Carlo methods in econometrics, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, and the emerging field of agent-based macroeconomics, and we argue that the methodological peculiarities present in all of these cases provide us with interesting lessons about the way in which the role of theory is conceived in economics.},

It shows how 'history of technology' can be integrated with the history of economic ideas. The analysis combines Cold War history with the history of postwar economics in America and later elsewhere, revealing that the Pax Americana had much to do with abstruse and formal doctrines such as linear programming and game theory. It links the literature on 'cyborg' to economics, an element missing in literature to date. The treatment further calls into question the idea that economics has been immune to postmodern currents, arguing that neoclassical economics has participated in the deconstruction of the integral 'self'. Finally, it argues for an alliance of computational and institutional themes, and challenges the widespread impression that there is nothing else besides American neoclassical economic theory left standing after the demise of Marxism.},

At issue are both the way in which particular calculations should be made and the choice of misspecification and other tests that are made available in the existing econometric software packages.},

On the one hand intellectual historians commonly accuse philosophers of writing bad - anachronistic - history of philosophy, and on the other, philosophers have accused intellectual historians of writing bad - antiquarian - history of philosophy. The essays here address this controversy and ask what purpose the history of philosophy should serve. Part I contains more purely theoretical and methodological discussion, of such questions as whether there are 'timeless' philosophical problems, whether the issues of one epoch are commensurable with those of another, and what style is appropriate to the historiography of the subject. The essays in Part II consider a number of case-histories. They present important revisionist scholarship and original contributions on topics drawn from ancient, early modern and more recent philosophy. All the essays have been specially commissioned, and the contributors include many of the leading figures in the field. The volume as a whole will be of vital interest to everyone concerned with the study of philosophy and of its history.},

Between 1988 and 1994, British households were more likely than US households to own a personal computer (PC). After 1994, however, US PC ownership rates accelerated rapidly, pushing the United States ahead of Britain. Differences in computer ownership rates are however much larger within the two countries, measured by income, education, age, family status, and race. Both the United States and Britain show large and growing inequality in PC ownership over the 1980s and 1990s. Analysis of ownership patterns of four other household consumer durables suggests that there may be significant limitations to relying solely on the market to eradicate PC inequality quickly.},

  abstract = {The emergence of experimental economics laboratories is tied to adopting computers as key instruments for conducting experimental research in economics. Various ways in which computer technology as a new form of material culture in experimental economics changed the practice of economics experimentation are examined. First, competing technologies for connecting computers and experimental subjects sitting behind them were used by two leading figures of experimental economics. Vernon Smith’s Economic Science Laboratory (ESL) at the University of Arizona, established in 1985, used touch-screen terminals connected to a time-sharing mainframe computer in Illinois. In contrast, Charles Plott’s Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science (EEPS) at Caltech, founded in 1987, used locally networked personal computers. Each technological solution had different implications for the laboratory infrastructure, the types of experiments that could easily be programmed and conducted, and the interaction of experimental subjects. Eventually, local ethernet networks became the standard, and EEPS became a model for other laboratories. Besides technological standardization, I also analyze computer technology’s operational and conceptual impact on experimental economics practice. However, one needs to go beyond investigating the experimental economics laboratory’s material culture to explain the laboratories’ rapid proliferation at the turn of the 1980s when experimental economics came of age. I identify the culture of sharing software among experimental economists as a key communal norm and part of experimental economists’ moral economy as a key factor in this transformation.},

We also assess the advantages of open source software from the point of view of reliability and discuss its potential in applied economics, which has now become fully dependent on computers. As a case study, we apply various accuracy tests on GNU Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library (gretl) and demonstrate that the open source nature of the program made it possible to see the cause, facilitated a rapid fix, and enabled verifying the correction of a number of flaws that we uncovered. We also run the same tests on four widely-used proprietary econometric packages and observe the known accuracy errors that remained uncorrected for more than 5~years.},
