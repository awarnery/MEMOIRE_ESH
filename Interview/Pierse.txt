- did an econometrics paper with roger bacon at Lincoln College, at LSE
- did not have money to do master at Oxford so keep on his summer job for a year at National statistical institute with Denise Osborn
(p2)
- forecast model of institute was getting to big to run, so he rewrote it and called it NIModel
- it spread because people took those software when moving across institution, found copy at London Business School and BoE
- after a year at NIS he goes to LSE because is now attracted to econometrics
- started at M1 because weak background in math
- had very good teachers
- does a MSc dissertation on exogenous policy switch with econometrics, coding and applied policy implications => suggested by David Hendry, application of an other paper
- he had only 4 years of funding and took 2 for his master so he did not had enough to finish his PhD with Denis Sargan
(p3)
- he did part time research assisstant with Andrew Harvey
- but wanted a proper job so quit LSE and goes to Cambridge Growth Project for 10 years
- they were doing a lot of forecast model funded by ESRC but losed the funding
- then he was getting older and more expensive so he took a job cat London Business School again in a macro modelling group
- he get back into programming at that time, on a version of NIModel
(p4)
- probably Stephen Hall who carried it around at LBS and BoE
- different version of the software because people used it to do different things, that became incompatible
- ended up in University of Surrey in 1995 were he do teaching for the first time, wasnâ€™t really into that idea 
(p5)
- applied to a research program from ESRC in 1994 to work on WinSolve 
- took early retirement in 2014
- touched to computer for the first time at 17 yo, as an option, get hooked to it
- wrote program and sent it to people that rewrote it on paper-tape, then run it and sent back results
- computer was a main frame in a air conditioned room
(p6)
- he wrote a compiler in spare time in high school and computer club at Oxford was also doing one
- a guy who did the computer option in high school adise him to apply to work at Departement of Environment between high school and Oxford. He got hired there for 8 months and did it again the next summer
- at Oxford, economics and computer was two very different thing and he happened to be involved in both
