While progress has been made, women in 2018 were only 32 percent of economics undergraduate students and 26 percent of academic economists. Our data also suggest several areas of stagnation and retreat. First, the percentage of female UK nationals studying economics is low and falling over time. Second, female economists are substantially more likely to be employed at lower academic ranks and in fixed-term—and generally lower status—teaching- and research-only positions. Third, the representation of women is especially low among ethnic minorities studying for an economics PhD. And finally, the percentage of economics professors with Asian ethnicity who are women has been falling over time, and at no point between 2012-2018 was a Black female professor of economics employed anywhere in the UK.},

Though many research economists instinctively know how to do so, most have spent too little time thinking about how one writes good research papers, and even the most successful economists often have a hard time articulating a clear answer to that question. This is due to both (i) what economists read and (ii) how they read it. The goal of this paper is to teach readers how to write applied economics papers that will eventually be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The various components of an applied economics paper are discussed in as much detail as possible, roughly in the order in which they are tackled in the context of the typical research project.},

Data from 1319 American first-year college students (872 female and 447 male) indicate that gender differences in computer self-efficacy, stereotypes, interests, values, interpersonal orientation, and personality exist. If students had had a positive experience in their first CS course, they had a stronger intention to take another CS course. A subset of 128 students (68 females and 60 males) took a CS course up to one year later. Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses. Furthermore, individuals who were highly conscientious and low in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades. Efforts to improve women’s representation in CS should bear these results in mind.},

As such, the histories written by econometricians reflect the scientific image of their discipline in a given period. Each image of a period is drawn by denominating forerunners and founding fathers and uses the language of the dominant philosophy of science of that day.             At the end of the nineteenth century, a scientific theory had to be mathematical; in the interbellum the image of science was that of logical positivism. In the 1970s and 1980s the dominant views were those of Karl Popper, Imre Lakatos, and Thomas Kuhn. Currently the scientific image in econometrics is the one of the Stanford school (Nancy Cartwright, Ian Hacking, and Patrick Suppes).},

The case of Dynare highlights how the dissemination across the profession of theoretical principles and modelling practices cannot be considered independently from (at least) two general issues that involve designing computer tools for macroeconomics: tractability (i.e. the existence of a computer algorithm that can solve a mathematical problem using “reasonable” resources) and portability (i.e. the material ability of circulating and transferring a computer algorithm across models, people, and institutions). In this article, we document how the origins and the development of Dynare over three decades were guided by these two issues.},

Mais les . outils de modélisation économique utilisés ont été fort différents, au moins jusqu'aux années 1970. En France, les débats se déroulaient' dans les «commissions du Plan», et étaient menés dans le langage des ingénieurs et des statisticiens, qui avaient, de fait, tendance à envisager l'économie «comme une seule grande entreprise» et non comme le lieu de la compétition marchande. Les planificateurs néerlandais, en revanche, étaient souvent des universitaires, plus extérieurs à l'État. Ils travaillaient aussi sur une économie tournée vers le commerce mondial depuis des siècles et s'appuyaient sur l'enchaînement dynamique des fluctuations d'une économie marchande autonome, comme on tente de monter un cheval au galop. Les Français avaient - une vision plus technique et quantitative d'une économie dont la dynamique des prix était restée longtemps mystérieuse. - Le cours de cette économie était réduit à son année horizon. En revanche, la procédure sociale de discussion détaillée de cet horizon était privilégiée, à travers un circuit compliqué d'experts, de comptables nationaux, de commissions et de groupes de travail. .},

  abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive overview of the structure, strategy and methods of assessment of orthodox theoretical economics. In Part I Professor Hausman explains how economists theorise, emphasising the essential underlying commitment of economists to a vision of economics as a separate science. In Part II he defends the view that the basic axioms of economics are 'inexact' since they deal only with the 'major' causes; unlike most writers on economic methodology, the author argues that it is the rules that economists espouse rather than their practice that is at fault. Part III links the conception of economics as a separate science to the fact that economic theories offer reasons and justifications for human actions, not just their causes. With its lengthy appendix introducing relevant issues in philosophy of science, this book is a major addition to philosophy of economics and of social science.},

A prior theoretical formulation can be retained unaltered while searching over more variables than the available sample size from non-stationary data to select congruent, encompassing relations with invariant parameters on valid conditioning variables.},

Unlike other technologies supporting science, software can be copied and distributed at essentially no cost, potentially opening the door to unprecedented levels of sharing and collaborative innovation. Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

  abstract = {Research software is a driving force in today's academic ecosystem, with most researchers relying on it to do their work, and many writing some of their own code. Despite its importance, research software is typically not included in tenure, promotion, and recognition policies and processes. In this article, we invite discussions on how to value research software, integrate it into academic evaluations, and ensure its sustainability. We build on discussions hosted by the US Research Software Sustainability Institute and by the international Research Software Engineering community to outline a set of possible activities aimed at elevating the role of research software in academic career paths, recognition, and beyond. One is a study to investigate the role of software contributions in academic promotions. Another is to document and share successful academic recognition practices for research software. A third is to create guidance documents for faculty hiring and tenure evaluations. Each of these proposed activities is a building block of a larger effort to create a more equitable, transparent, and dynamic academic ecosystem. We've assembled 44 such ideas as a starting point and posted them as issues in GitHub {$<$}https://github.com/si2-urssi/policy/issues?q=is\%3Aissue+is\%3Aopen+label\%3AActivity{$>$} . Our aim is to encourage engagement with this effort. Readers are invited to do this by adding potential activities or commenting on existing ideas to improve them. The issues page can also serve to inform the community of ongoing activities so that efforts aren't duplicated. Similarly, if someone else has already made strides in a particular area, point out their work to build collective knowledge. Finally, the issues page is also intended to allow anyone interested in collaborating on a specific activity to indicate their willingness to do so. This living list serves as a hub for collective action and thought, with the overall aim of recognizing the value of creating and contributing research software.},

  abstract = {Although economics is becoming increasing computational, economists are still ill at ease with simulation methods. We review central questions in the philosophy of simulation: what distinguishes simulations from other models and experiments? In what sense can simulations produce novel results? What implications does the epistemic opacity of simulations have for their explanatory value? We then explore these questions in the context of the Monte Carlo methods in econometrics, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, and the emerging field of agent-based macroeconomics, and we argue that the methodological peculiarities present in all of these cases provide us with interesting lessons about the way in which the role of theory is conceived in economics.},

  abstract = {This was the first cross-over book into the history of science written by an historian of economics.  It shows how 'history of technology' can be integrated with the history of economic ideas. The analysis combines Cold War history with the history of postwar economics in America and later elsewhere, revealing that the Pax Americana had much to do with abstruse and formal doctrines such as linear programming and game theory. It links the literature on 'cyborg' to economics, an element missing in literature to date. The treatment further calls into question the idea that economics has been immune to postmodern currents, arguing that neoclassical economics has participated in the deconstruction of the integral 'self'. Finally, it argues for an alliance of computational and institutional themes, and challenges the widespread impression that there is nothing else besides American neoclassical economic theory left standing after the demise of Marxism.},

On the one hand intellectual historians commonly accuse philosophers of writing bad - anachronistic - history of philosophy, and on the other, philosophers have accused intellectual historians of writing bad - antiquarian - history of philosophy. The essays here address this controversy and ask what purpose the history of philosophy should serve. Part I contains more purely theoretical and methodological discussion, of such questions as whether there are 'timeless' philosophical problems, whether the issues of one epoch are commensurable with those of another, and what style is appropriate to the historiography of the subject. The essays in Part II consider a number of case-histories. They present important revisionist scholarship and original contributions on topics drawn from ancient, early modern and more recent philosophy. All the essays have been specially commissioned, and the contributors include many of the leading figures in the field. The volume as a whole will be of vital interest to everyone concerned with the study of philosophy and of its history.},
